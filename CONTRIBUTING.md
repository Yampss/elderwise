# Contributing to ElderWise

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ElderWise as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature already exists or is planned
2. Open an issue with the "enhancement" label
3. Describe the feature and why it would be valuable
4. Include mockups or examples if helpful

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Comment complex logic

## Areas Where We Need Help

- **Accessibility**: Making the platform more inclusive for users with disabilities
- **Content**: Creating story prompts and improving categorization
- **UI/UX**: Improving the user interface and experience
- **Testing**: Writing tests for existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Improving guides and tutorials
- **Internationalization**: Adding support for multiple languages

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a conda environment: `conda create -n elderwise python=3.11`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate elderwise`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
